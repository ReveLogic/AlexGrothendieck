## All Dreams Are a Creation of the Dreamer

1.2  **Revealing the Dreamer**

We ourselves are blind, in other words, we cannot see anything in this tangle of forces at work within us, which nevertheless 
inexorably govern our lives (at least as long as we do not make the effort to become aware of them...). We are blind, 
yes - but there is within us an eye that sees, and a Hand that paints what is seen. The slumbering silence of sleep and night serve as its canvas, 
we ourselves are its palette; and the sensations, feelings, thoughts that pass through us in dreaming, and the impulses and forces that stir our waking hours, 
these are Its paint tubes, to brush this living tableau that only It knows how to paint. A parabolic painting, yes, sketched offhand or artfully composed, 
farce or elegy and sometimes an inexorable and poignant drama...- gracefully offered to our attention! It is up to us to decipher it and take a lesson, if we wish. 
Take it or leave it!

Blind to ourselves, we see nothing in the tangled mess of forces within us that inexorably dictate our lives - unless we make the effort to perceive them. 
Yet within us resides an eye that sees, and a Hand that paints what it sees. The quiet stillness of sleep and night provides Its canvas, while we ourselves become Its palette; 
the sensations, feelings, and thoughts that move within us while we dream, as well as the impulses and forces that stir us in our waking hours, are Its paint, creating a living portrait that It alone knows how to craft. 
It is a parable in paint, composed offhandedly or with great care, at times a farce or an elegy, and at others a tragic, unrelenting drama - all offered up to our gaze. It is up to us to decipher Its meaning and take from it what we will.

And yet time and time again, we turn away, leaving these gifts unopened. Even among those who now proudly wear the banner of "dreamers" 
(a recent and admirable trend), how many have dared to plumb the depths of their own dreams - to glean the rich lessons waiting there to be learned?

This book, which I am starting to write today, is first and foremost intended for the very few (if any besides myself) who dare to delve deep into certain dreams. For those who dare to believe in their dreams and the messages they bring.
If you are one of them, I want this book to be an encouragement to you, if needed, to have faith in your dreams. And also, to have faith (as I have had faith) in your ability to hear their message. 
(And to see your most firmly held convictions crumble one by one, to see your life transform before your eyes...)

Perhaps the dream knowledge I strive to impart
May help you avoid certain stumbling blocks and detours
I had to traverse in my journey to self-discovery
Unbeknownst to me, this voyage was to become
The discovery of the Dreamer - that benevolent and mischievous
Painter and Stage-Setter, with penetrating gaze and prodigious means
That Eye and that Hand of which I have spoken.

From the first dream that I scrutinized, revealing myself to myself in a moment of deep crisis, 
I knew that this dream did not come from me. That it was an unexpected, prodigious gift, a gift of Life, 
that someone greater than myself was giving me. And gradually, I understood that it is He and no one else who "makes," 
who creates each of these dreams that we live, we, docile actors in His delicate and powerful hands. We ourselves appear as "dreamers," 
even as "dreamt" - created in and by this dream that we are carrying out, animated by a breath that does not come from us.

If one were to ask me today about my work with dreams and its most valuable outcome, I would answer without hesitation: 
it is to have allowed me to meet the Master of Dreams. By scrutinizing His works, I have gradually learned to know Him, 
to whom nothing in me is hidden. And most recently, as a culmination of a long quest that was unaware of itself, 
I have finally learned His name. Perhaps the same will happen for you. Perhaps your dreams with their thousand faces 
will also lead you to find the One who speaks to you through them. The One, the Unique. If this book can help you even a little in this endeavor, 
it will not have been written in vain.
