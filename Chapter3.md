## All Dreams Are a Creation of the Dreamer

1.3  **The child and the dreamer**

I came to my dreams like a little child: my mind empty, my hands bare. 
What drove me towards some of them, what made me search them with such eager zeal,
was something deeper than the curiosity of an alert mind, intrigued by a strange 
"phenomenon", or fascinated by a troubling mystery, moved by a poignant beauty. 
It was something deeper than all of that. It was a hunger that I couldn't name myself. 
It was the soul that was hungry. And by some mysterious grace, added to the appearance of this or that dream "unlike any other," 
I sometimes felt both this hunger and the food destined for me. I was like an undernourished, weak, 
and hungry infant who senses the breast nearby.

This reality, I only perceived it recently. At the time, and for many years afterwards, I did not view myself in 
such humble and nearly pitiful tones. 
Me, weak? No way!

This was not complacency, nor an unconscious bad faith. The strength I felt within me, with an undeniable evidence, 
is indeed real, and precious. But it exists at a completely different level. It is not that of the soul, 
of a soul that has reached its adult state, in full maturity. I had eyes to see, and I also had well-established ideas 
about a reality that I called "spiritual", and that I saw quite clearly. Now (recently), I realize that the spiritual 
reality is something other than what I called it. I only had a very confused experience of it then, and my eyes did not see it. 
They are only beginning to open to that reality now.

Like a newborn, who cannot see the breast,
And yet feels its approach, and demands to feed and rest.
There's a spiritual instinct in man's soul,
Even before his spiritual eyes begin to unroll.
Blessed is he who can sense this instinct,
And follow its call without a hint.
For he shall find nourishment and delight,
As the breast is always near, within sight.
And his eyes shall eventually open wide,
To witness the wonders of the spiritual tide.
