## All Dreams Are a Creation of the Dreamer

1.4  **All dreams come from the Dreamer.**

If I have learned about dreams the things that cannot be found in books, 
it is because I approached them with a spirit of innocence, like a little child. 
And I have no doubt that if you do the same, you will learn, not only about yourself, 
but also about dreams and the Dreamer, things that are not in this book or any other. 
For the Dreamer loves to reveal Himself to those who come to Him as children. 
And what He reveals to one is not necessarily what He reveals to another. 
Yet the two will agree and complement each other.

That is why, to get to know your dreams and the One who speaks to you through them, 
you need not read me or anyone else. But learning about my journey and what I have seen along 
the way may encourage you to embark on or continue your journey, and to open your eyes wide.

For a long time, I only noted down the dreams that struck me the most, 
and not even all of them. Even when carefully noted, most of these dreams 
remained completely enigmatic to me. Did they even have a meaning? I wouldn't have ventured to say. 
Some, especially among those I didn't note, did they hold a meaning, a message to unfold? 
I dared not say, for some seemed but tales of madness, not a signal to convey.

It was in August 1982, six years after my first work on a dream, that a second major turning 
point occurred in my relationship with dreams and the Dreamer. At that moment, 
I understood that every dream held a meaning, often hidden (deliberately, surely) 
behind bewildering appearances - that they all come from the same Hand. That each dream, 
no matter how insignificant or obscene it may seem, or how nonsensical or flawed, or fragmented or hazy... that each dream without exception is a living word from the Dreamer; a word often playful, 
or a laugh behind serious or even mournful airs (only He can catch and bring out the humor or the absurd, 
even where it is least expected...); a pithy or a lively word, never banal, always relevant, 
always instructive, and beneficial - a creation, in a word, fresh from the hands of the Dreamer! 
A unique thing, different from all those that were or will ever be created, 
and created right before your eyes and with your involuntary contribution, 
without drum or trumpet and (it would seem) for your sole benefit. 
A princely gift, indeed, and a gift in its purest form, entirely free. 
No obligation for gratitude from you, not even to take note, or to even acknowledge it with a glance. Incredible, and yet true!

What is true, in any case, is that among the multitude of dreams I have noted throughout the past ten years 
(there must be close to a thousand, of which three or four hundred of which I was able to grasp the message), 
there isn't a single one that now gives me the impression of being an exception to the rule; of being, not a creation, 
but the product of some more or less blind psychological mechanism, or of some force seeking gratification, 
whether that be of the senses, or of vanity. In all of them, without exception, through all their prodigious diversity, 
I sense the same "mark", I perceive the same breath. This breath is not mechanical, and it does not come from me.
