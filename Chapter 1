## All Dreams Are a Creation of the Dreamer

1.1  **First Encounters - Where Dreams and Self-Awareness Meet**


(April 30th, 1987) I experienced a momentous event that would forever change the trajectory of my life: the comprehension of the first dream.
It was a profound encounter that ignited a transformational journey within me, leading to a newfound awareness of the existence of my soul and 
the realization that there was an alternate self within me that had been silenced for too long.
This moment was experienced, truly, as a profound renewal, as a new birth. In retrospect, I would now say that it was the moment of reunion with my soul, 
from which I had been separated since the forgotten days of my early childhood. Until then, I had lived in ignorance that I had a "soul," that there was another 
self within me, silent and almost invisible, yet alive and vigorous - someone quite different from the one within me who constantly took center stage, the only one I saw and with 
whom I begrudgingly identified: "the Master," "the me," the one that I knew all too well, ad nauseum. But that day was a day of reunion with the other - the one I thought dead and buried 
for what seemed like an eternity - with the child that still lived within me.

The ten years that have passed since that day now appear to me, above all, as a series of periods of learning, marked by the crossing of successive "thresholds" 
in my spiritual journey. These were periods of reflection and intense listening, where I got to know myself, both with "the Master" and with "the Other". 
For to mature spiritually is nothing more or less than to get to know oneself; it is to progress little by little in this never-ending self-knowledge. 
It is to learn, and above all, to learn about oneself. And it is also to renew oneself, to die a little, to separate oneself from a dead weight, from inertia, 
from a part of the "old man" within us - and to be reborn!


Without self-knowledge, there can be no understanding of others, no comprehension of the world of humanity, nor of the works of God within humanity. 
Time and time again, I have observed in myself, in my friends and loved ones, as well as in what is called the "Creative Works" (including those of great renown), 
that without self-knowledge, the image we have of the world and of others is nothing but the blind and lifeless product of our cravings, hopes, fears, frustrations, deliberate ignorance, 
escapes, and resignations, as well as all our repressed impulses of violence. It is also the product of the consensus and opinions that hold sway around us and shape us to their measure. 
This image has little more than distant, indirect, and convoluted connections to the reality it purports to represent, and it distorts that reality without shame. 
It's akin to a witness who is half-foolish and half-corrupt, testifying in a case that affects him more than he's willing to acknowledge. Unbeknownst to him, his testimony not only implicates 
but also judges him.

As I reflect on the major stages of my inner journey, I realize that each one of them, much like the first I spoke of earlier, was prepared for and marked by one or several dreams. 
The story of my maturation towards self-knowledge and understanding of the human soul is closely intertwined with my dream experience. Put another way: the knowledge 
I have gained about myself and the psyche in general is almost inseparable from my experience of dreams and the understanding of dreams that is one of their fruits.

This is no mere coincidence, but rather a profound truth. I have come to know, often begrudgingly, that the deepest recesses of the psyche elude even the most intrepid and curious of conscious eyes. 
Left to its own devices, and even with the aid of rigorous and persistent reflection (which I call "meditation"), this sight scarcely penetrates beyond the surface. I now doubt that any person in this world, 
not even one as revered as the Buddha himself, has ever truly glimpsed the state and activity of the psyche's innermost layers.
Such a person would almost be equal to God, would they not? I have not come across any testimony that would suggest that such a prodigious faculty has ever been bestowed upon anyone.

It is true that everything that exists and moves within the psyche seeks and finds visible expression. This can manifest on the level of consciousness itself (through thoughts, feelings, attitudes, etc.), 
or in the realm of actions and behavior, or even at the level of the body and its functions (often referred to as "psychosomatic" in scholarly jargon). But all of these manifestations, whether psychic, social, 
or corporeal, are so deeply hidden, so thoroughly disguised, that it often requires an almost superhuman level of intuition and perspicacity to extract even a somewhat nuanced narrative of the unconscious forces and 
conflicts that underlie them. Dreams, on the other hand, reveal themselves as a direct testimony, perfectly reliable and of incomparable subtlety, to the profound life of the psyche that lies behind often disconcerting 
and always enigmatic appearances. Each dream constitutes a true masterpiece, drawn with a skilled hand, with its own unique lighting and perspective, a benevolent intention, and often a penetrating message.
