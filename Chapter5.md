## All Dreams Are a Creation of the Dreamer

1.5  **Messenger Dreams-or the moment of truth**

But in the early years, I didn't ask myself any such questions. 
I paid no attention to dreams that at that time still appeared to me as "random." 
And even among those I recorded, I only lingered on the dreams that I then called the "messenger dreams." 
These were, in short, those for which it was immediately clear, by some obscure foreknowledge, 
that they were indeed carriers of a "message."

Now that I know that every dream carries a message, and that dreams of humble appearance can express a message 
of great significance, the term "messenger dream" seems ambiguous to me, and I have some hesitation in using it again. 
These are also the dreams that immediately attract attention as "great dreams." "Great" not necessarily by their length or duration, 
or by the number of episodes or distinctive details; but in the sense that sometimes a work of art or the mind—a painting, novel, film, or 
even a destiny—impacts us as something "great." One sign of such a dream is an exceptional sharpness of perceptions and thoughts, 
and sometimes a powerful and moving strength of emotions, as if the Dreamer wants to shake up our entrenched inertia, wake us up, and shout loudly at us: 
"Wake up, you sleepyhead! Open your eyes and heed the message I'm shouting at you with every fiber of my being!"

These are also the dreams with transparent language, without any secret code or wordplay, without anything that hides or veils. 
The message appears with dazzling clarity, indelible, traced in the very flesh of your soul by an invisible and powerful Hand, 
itself a living and vibrating letter of the Word addressed to you. And each word carries a sense that concerns you and no one else, 
and it is placed in your hand so that you can grasp it. He who speaks in your heart like no one else in the world could speak to you, knows you 
infinitely better and more intimately than you know yourself. When the time comes, better than anyone, He knows what living words will resonate deeply within you, 
and what secret strings they will make vibrate.

In brief, the "messenger dream" is one where the Dreamer "puts in the effort" to tell you what He has to say to you, with exceptional force and clarity. 
If he puts so much emphasis on it, it's certainly because the message is exceptional as well, that it's telling you something essential, something that you absolutely need to know. 
Perhaps the dream comes to reveal to you unsuspected resources buried in your being—a fearless strength that is still unaware, or an empty depth, or a calling that awaits, 
a destiny to be fulfilled... something you never dared to dream about while awake! Or perhaps it has come to encourage you to break away from some crushing weight that you've been dragging for years, 
maybe even your entire life...

Listening to such a dream, hearing its evident, irrefutable message, and accepting the knowledge it brings to you, 
accepting this truth that is offered to you—that is also to see your life change deeply, in that very moment. 
It's to change, to renew yourself, in that moment.
You will never be the same person you were before the moment of truth.
That's why it's so rare for a word so scorching to be heard, for a gift so invaluable to be accepted. 
Because in each of us lies a great inertia, opposed to anything that changes us and renews us. 
And few are those in whom this inertia of the soul is not accompanied by an un penetrable, deeply buried fear.

This fear is far more powerful and intense than the fear of illness, destruction, or death. 
And it has many faces. One of them is the fear of knowing - of knowing oneself. 
Another is the fear of finding oneself, of being oneself. And yet another is the great fear 
of change.
